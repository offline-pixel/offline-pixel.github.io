            <p>This partnership is built on clear roles and mutual benefit, making it simple and highly rewarding:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Your Role: The Client Finder.</strong>
                    <p>Your primary objective is to identify businesses that need web or app development services. Think about:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Small businesses with no online presence or an outdated website.</li>
                        <li>Entrepreneurs looking to build a new app or web platform for their startup.</li>
                        <li>Companies needing custom software to improve efficiency or provide new services.</li>
                        <li>Any business whose digital presence lags behind its competitors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Your Action: Make a Warm Introduction.</strong>
                    <p>Once you've identified a potential client, reach out to them. Briefly explain the value of professional web/app development and mention your connection to a reliable, expert team (Offline Pixel Computers) that can help them achieve their digital goals.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Your Crucial Step: Facilitate the Initial Consultation.</strong>
                    <p>This is where your partnership truly shines. Your key contribution is to <b>facilitate an introduction and set up a brief call</b>between your potential client and our team. This direct conversation allows our experts to understand their specific needs, answer questions, and propose a tailored solution.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Our Role: The Developers Who Deliver.</strong>
                    <p>Once the initial call is made, Offline Pixel Computers takes over completely. We will:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Conduct in-depth consultations and gather detailed requirements.</li>
                        <li>Prepare comprehensive proposals and project estimates.</li>
                        <li>Handle all aspects of design, development, testing, and deployment.</li>
                        <li>Manage client communication and ensure project milestones are met.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You can relax, knowing your referral is in expert hands, and you never have to worry about the technical execution.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Your Reward: The Commission.</strong>
                    <p>Once the web or app development project is successfully completed and the client makes their final payment to Offline Pixel Computers, you receive a generous <b>10% commission</b>on the total project value.</p>
                    <p><strong>Earning $1250+/Month:</strong> A typical professional web development project often ranges from $5,000 to $15,000. A single $12,500 project yields $1,250 in commission. Landing just one to two such projects per month can comfortably put you over the $1250 monthly target, offering a scalable income without technical headaches.</p>
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Finding Your Clients: Opportunities Across the USA</h2>
            <p>The demand for web and app development is universal. Here's where to focus your "client finding" efforts:</p>

            <h3>1. Local Businesses & Service Providers</h3>
            <p>Many still operate with minimal or outdated digital presences:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Restaurants, Cafes, Bars:</strong> Often need online ordering systems, reservation platforms, or modern menu displays.</li>
                <li><strong>Salons, Spas, Fitness Studios:</strong> Require online booking, client management portals, and engaging service showcases.</li>
                <li><strong>Small Retailers:</strong> Need e-commerce websites to reach a broader audience or inventory management solutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Services (Law, Accounting, Medical):</strong> Benefit from secure client portals, appointment scheduling, and professional informational sites.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Startups & Entrepreneurs</h3>
            <p>Constantly seeking to build their Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) and digital platforms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tech Hubs:</strong> New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Boston, Austin, Denver, Atlanta, Miami are bustling with new ventures.</li>
                <li><strong>Online Startup Communities:</strong> Platforms like Product Hunt, AngelList, or industry-specific forums are places where founders seek development partners.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Observing Digital Gaps</h3>
            <p>Your everyday observations can turn into lucrative leads:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Poorly Designed Websites:</strong> If a business's site looks unprofessional, is hard to navigate, or isn't mobile-friendly.</li>
                <li><strong>Businesses Relying Solely on Social Media:</strong> While important, it's not a substitute for a dedicated, owned web presence.</li>
                <li><strong>Manual Processes:</strong> If you see a business doing something manually that could clearly be automated by a custom app or software.</li>
            </ul>
