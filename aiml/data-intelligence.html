    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq">
      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Q: What kind of data do I need for time-series forecasting?</strong>
        <p>A: You typically need historical data points collected at regular intervals (e.g., daily sales, hourly temperature readings, monthly website visitors). The longer the history and the more consistent the intervals, the better the forecasts.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Q: Can you help with custom NLP models beyond basic text analysis?</strong>
        <p>A: Yes. While we utilize powerful libraries like spaCy and NLTK, our expertise extends to building and fine-tuning custom NLP models for highly specific tasks, such as industry-specific entity extraction, complex document summarization, or advanced conversational AI, essential for sophisticated AI Agent product builders.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Q: How do you ensure the accuracy of your forecasts?</strong>
        <p>A: We employ rigorous validation techniques, including cross-validation and backtesting, to assess model performance on unseen data. We also provide clear metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE) and confidence intervals for our forecasts, allowing MVP Developers to make informed decisions.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Q: Is Data Intelligence suitable for small businesses?</strong>
        <p>A: Absolutely. Data Intelligence, especially with targeted MVP development, can provide significant benefits to small businesses by optimizing operations, improving customer understanding, and enabling smarter decision-making without requiring a large upfront investment. We tailor solutions to your scale and budget.</p>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <strong>Q: What is the difference between Prophet and ARIMA?</strong>
        <p>A: Prophet is designed for business forecasting with human-in-the-loop adjustments, excelling at data with strong seasonal components and handling missing data well. ARIMA is a more traditional statistical model that requires data stationarity and is excellent for capturing autocorrelation patterns. We choose the best model based on your data characteristics and forecasting needs.</p>
