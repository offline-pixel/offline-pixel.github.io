    <!-- 2. What is Playwright? -->
    <h2>What is Playwright and Why <b>Hire a Playwright Expert</b>?</h2>
    <p><strong>Playwright</strong> is an open-source automation library developed by Microsoft, designed for reliable end-to-end testing, web scraping, and general browser automation. It supports all modern rendering engines including Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox, and runs across Windows, Linux, and macOS. With its powerful APIs available in multiple languages (Node.js, Python, Java, .NET), Playwright offers unparalleled capabilities for interacting with web pages. To build truly stable and scalable automation, you need to <b>hire a Playwright expert</b>.</p>
    <div class="tip">
      <strong>Playwright Analogy:</strong> Think of <strong>Playwright</strong> as a highly skilled, multi-talented robot that can precisely interact with any website across different browsers, mimicking human behavior perfectly. While you could try to build this robot yourself, hiring a <b>Playwright engineer</b> means you get an expert who knows how to program it for maximum efficiency, reliability, and complex tasks.
    </div>
    <p>Playwright's auto-waiting capabilities, retry-ability, and rich set of assertions make it a top choice for creating resilient and less flaky tests. For businesses, QA teams, and data analysts, it offers the flexibility to automate complex user flows, extract specific data, and ensure application quality across the evolving web landscape. When you <b>hire a Playwright developer</b>, you're investing in automation that truly works.</p>
