    <!-- 2. What is MEAN Stack? -->
    <h2>What is MEAN Stack and Why <b>Hire a MEAN Stack Developer</b>?</h2>
    <p>The <b>MEAN Stack</b> is a powerful, open-source JavaScript-based framework for building dynamic web applications. It stands for:
      <ul>
        <li><b>M</b>ongoDB (NoSQL database)</li>
        <li><b>E</b>xpress.js (web application framework for Node.js)</li>
        <li><b>A</b>ngular (front-end JavaScript framework)</li>
        <li><b>N</b>ode.js (JavaScript runtime environment)</li>
      </ul>
      This combination provides a complete end-to-end JavaScript solution, allowing a single language to be used across the entire development process, from server to client. To fully leverage its unified ecosystem and rapid development capabilities, you need to <b>hire a MEAN Stack developer</b>.</p>
    <div class="tip">
      <strong>MEAN Stack Analogy:</strong> Think of the <strong>MEAN Stack</strong> as a finely tuned, all-JavaScript orchestra. Each component plays a crucial role, working harmoniously to create a powerful web application. Hiring a <b>MEAN Stack developer</b> means you get a conductor who understands every instrument and how to make them play together perfectly for your unique project.
    </div>
    <p>The MEAN Stack is renowned for its flexibility, scalability, and ability to build single-page applications (SPAs) and real-time applications with speed and efficiency. Its unified JavaScript environment reduces context switching for developers, leading to faster development cycles and easier maintenance. When you <b>hire a MEAN Stack developer</b>, you're investing in a streamlined, modern, and highly capable web solution.</p>

      <li><strong>Authentication & Authorization:</strong> Implementing robust security measures, including secure token-based authentication (e.g., JWT), role-based access control (RBAC), and proper session management.</li>
      <li><strong>Database Security (MongoDB):</strong> Configuring MongoDB with authentication, authorization, encryption (at rest and in transit), and restricting network access.</li>
      <li><strong>API Security (Express.js):</strong> Securing RESTful APIs with measures like rate limiting, CORS policies, helmet.js for HTTP headers, and protecting against common Node.js vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Dependency Management & Updates:</strong> Regularly auditing and updating all Node.js packages and Angular libraries to mitigate known vulnerabilities, using tools like `npm audit`.</li>
      <li><strong>Secure Deployment:</strong> Implementing secure server configurations, using HTTPS, setting up firewalls, and establishing robust CI/CD pipelines for secure and reliable deployments.</li>
      <li><strong>Error Handling & Logging:</strong> Implementing centralized and secure error logging without exposing sensitive information, crucial for monitoring and incident response.</li>
