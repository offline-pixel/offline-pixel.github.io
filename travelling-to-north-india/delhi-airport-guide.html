    <!-- 2. Your Arrival at Delhi Airport: First Steps -->
    <h2>Your Arrival at Delhi Airport (IGI): First Steps for Foreign Travellers</h2>
    <p>Stepping off the plane at <b>Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGI) in Delhi</b> is the beginning of your North India journey. Here's what <strong class="text-travel-accent">foreign travellers</strong> need to expect and how to navigate your first hours:</p>
    <div class="tip">
      <strong>Pro Tip for Delhi Airport:</strong> Keep copies of your <b>e-Visa printout</b>, passport, and flight itinerary easily accessible. Have a pen ready for any forms to ensure a smooth immigration process.
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Immigration & Visa:</strong> Have your passport and valid Indian visa (e-Visa printout or stamped visa) ready. Be prepared for queues, especially during peak seasons.</li>
        <li><strong>Currency Exchange:</strong> You'll find official currency exchange counters and ATMs in the arrival hall. Exchange a small amount for immediate needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Local SIM Card for Travellers:</strong> Consider purchasing a local SIM card from providers like Airtel, Jio, or Vodafone Idea at the airport kiosks. You'll need your passport, visa, and a passport-sized photo. This is essential for staying connected as a <strong class="text-travel-accent">solo traveller in Delhi</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Baggage Claim:</strong> Follow signs to retrieve your luggage. Double-check your baggage tags.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 3. Getting from Delhi Airport to Your Accommodation -->
    <h2>Safe & Easy Transport from New Delhi Airport for All Travellers</h2>
    <p>Your first ride from <b>New Delhi Airport</b> is crucial. Avoid potential <b>tourist scams</b> by using trusted options, especially important for <strong class="text-travel-accent">solo and female travellers</strong>:</p>

    <div class="ai-concept">
      <h3>Recommended Transport Options in Delhi</h3>
      <div class="tech-stack">
        <span class="tech-pill">Airport Express Metro</span>
        <span class="tech-pill">Pre-paid Taxis</span>
        <span class="tech-pill">Uber / Ola (Ride-hailing Apps)</span>
        <span class="tech-pill">Hotel Transfers</span>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Airport Express Metro (Orange Line):</strong> The fastest and most affordable way to central Delhi (New Delhi Railway Station, Shivaji Stadium). Clean, efficient, and avoids traffic. It's often recommended for <strong class="text-travel-accent">solo female travellers in Delhi</strong> for its safety.</li>
        <li><strong>Official Pre-paid Taxis:</strong> Located just outside the terminal. Pay at the counter, get a receipt, and you'll be assigned a taxi. Ensures a fixed fare and helps prevent overcharging.</li>
        <li><strong>Ride-Hailing Apps (Uber/Ola):</strong> Download these apps before arrival. You can book a cab from designated pick-up points at the airport. Convenient and offers transparent pricing. They often have safety features like live tracking, beneficial for <strong class="text-travel-accent">solo travellers in New Delhi</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Hotel Transfers:</strong> Many hotels offer pre-arranged airport pickups. This is often the most hassle-free option, though usually more expensive, providing peace of mind for <strong class="text-travel-accent">foreign travellers in Delhi</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="ai-concept">
      <h3>Avoiding Common Tourist Scams in Delhi</h3>
      <div class="tech-stack">
        <span class="tech-pill">Unsolicited Help</span>
        <span class="tech-pill">Fake Tourist Offices</span>
        <span class="tech-pill">"Hotel is Closed" Taxis</span>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Ignore Unsolicited Offers:</strong> At the airport, decline offers from individuals claiming to be guides, taxi drivers, or helpful strangers. Stick to official counters. This is a common tactic, particularly for <strong class="text-travel-accent">foreign travellers in New Delhi</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Beware of Fake "Tourist Information" Booths:</strong> Only use government-approved tourist information centers or your hotel for advice.</li>
        <li><strong>"Your Hotel is Closed/Burned Down" Tactic:</strong> Some rogue taxi drivers may tell you your pre-booked hotel is closed or full to take you to a commission-based alternative. Insist on going to your original destination. Always have your hotel's address and contact number handy.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <hr class="section-separator"/>

    <!-- 4. Cultural Immersion: Do's and Don'ts for Foreigners -->
    <h2>Cultural Immersion: Do's and Don'ts for Travellers in Delhi</h2>
    <p>Embrace the vibrant culture of North India. A little awareness goes a long way in ensuring a respectful and enriching experience for all <strong class="text-travel-accent">travellers in Delhi</strong>, especially <strong class="text-travel-accent">foreign travellers</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Modest Dress:</strong> Especially in religious sites and smaller towns, dress conservatively. Cover your shoulders and knees. Loose, breathable clothing is comfortable and respectful. This is particularly important for <strong class="text-travel-accent">female travellers in New Delhi</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Greetings:</strong> A gentle "Namaste" with folded hands is a widely appreciated greeting. Handshakes are common in urban areas, but wait for the other person to initiate.</li>
      <li><strong>Footwear Etiquette:</strong> Always remove your shoes before entering homes, temples, and gurdwaras. Look for designated shoe-keeping areas.</li>
      <li><strong>Public Displays of Affection (PDA):</strong> Keep PDA to a minimum. It's generally frowned upon in public spaces in India.</li>
      <li><strong>Eating & Hands:</strong> Traditionally, eat with your right hand. The left hand is considered unclean.</li>
      <li><strong>Bargaining:</strong> It's expected in local markets for souvenirs and clothes, but do it politely and with a smile. Enjoy the experience!</li>
      <li><strong>Photography:</strong> Always ask permission before photographing people, especially women. Be respectful if someone declines.</li>
      <li><strong>Religious Sensitivity:</strong> Respect local customs in religious places. Avoid pointing your feet towards deities.</li>
    </ul>
