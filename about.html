    <h1 class="title">My Journey: From Overwhelmed Coder to Product Catalyst</h1>
    <p class="description">
      Years ago, I was like many founders and developers — overwhelmed by tech choices, constantly firefighting bugs, and struggling to build fast enough. I saw brilliant ideas die not because they lacked potential, but because they lacked execution speed.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      So I built my own tools. Modular, reusable, and fast. Now I launch full-stack MVPs in 4–7 weeks with AI scaffolding and automated pipelines.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      Today, I work with startup founders, fintech builders, and indie hackers to take their vision from napkin sketch to real product — in record time.
